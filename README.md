# Javadoc2Haxe

## Usage

Create a [Haxe](http://haxe.org)/Java extern for a Java class by:

 1. Visit its library's Javadoc page, select the class.
 2. Click on Javadoc2Haxe's icon next to the class name.
 3. Copy and paste to your project.

Remember the generated extern is hardly perfect. Edit where you think is needed.
